# week3-assignment-cookie-clicker

This is a cookie clicker game

- 🎯 Fetch upgrade data from the provided API and at least one upgrade from the API update the cookie count.
  Done

- 🎯 Ensure that functions are used effectively to keep code organised and reusable.
  -Done somewhat although there was a lot of room for streamlining

- 🎯 Implement event listeners to handle user interactions.
  done

- 🎯 Use local storage to save and restore the cookie count and relevant game information.
  done

- 🎯 Use `setInterval` to increment the cookie count and manage the game state each second.
  done

- 🎯 Managing the game state includes saving progress and updating the DOM.
  Done

- 🏹 Consolidate upgrade management by managing all upgrades in a single function.
  I did not do this. I spent a lot of time trying to but i kept running into various issues so i prioritised getting the code working at the cost of clean efficient code

- 🏹 Improve UX with animations, sound effects, or other visual effects.
  done somewhat, main constraint was time

- 🏹 Fantastic use of README to provide important information such as a description of the project, how to deploy and other app information.
  done somewhat

- 🏹 Implement error handling using try/catch.
  not done - not quite sure what is meant here

- 🏹 Create a menu for users to adjust game options like sound effects or display preferences.
  -not done due to time

Optional 🏹 Feel free to add any other reflections you would like to share about your submission, for example:

Requesting feedback about a specific part of your submission. What useful external sources helped you complete the assignment (e.g YouTube tutorials)?
This week most of the knowledge I already had from prior assignments. I did use a basic google search to find how to add sound effects to event listeners and how to update the title bar in javascript

What errors or bugs did you encounter while completing your assignment?
I really struggled with manipulating the fetched api data without running into all sorts of problems. I spent so long on this that i was at risk of not completing the project so in the end i used local storage to store the api data. I also created a separate event handler for each button in the upgrade store. I'm sure there is a better way. I tried a general solution but just couldnt get it to work.

How did you solve them?
I went for practicality and so wrote quite inefficient code just to get it to work. My problem was really writing the code efficiently

What went really well and what could have gone better?
It worked! For a time i worried that it wouldn't so its a relief that i have a working page. and looks somewhat presentable. If i had more time i would style my website better. And as mentioned before, my code is too long and repetitive
